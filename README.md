# WebDesignFinal

<p> This project is for my Fundamentals of Web Design Final. I was tasked with creating 5 web pages with similar themes but different content. </p>
<p>The homepage gives a general overview of myself. </p>
<p>The next page is Class Work. This page contains my best work from this term's class. </p>
<p>The third page is Kenya Water Solutions. The page talks about the Kenya Water project that my 1st block class is undertaking. </p>
<p>The next page is Boys State. This page details my time at Hawkeye Boys State during the summer before my senior year of high school. </p>
<p>The final page is Language. The page is about the next computer language that I'd like to learn about. </p>
