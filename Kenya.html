        <p>This project incorporates real world design problems with serious
          curriculum understanding. This is part of the capstone class Engineering Design and Develpment (EDD).</p>

      <p>When Joshua Ngao informed us about the water crisis in his home village of Muamba,
        our team decided that it was a problem that we wanted to devote our time to. We
        researched the problem and came up with three different solutions, each of them
        filtering water using a unique method.  </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>


      <p>The Kenyan village of Muamba lacks clean water. Current water filtration systems
        are not efficient or cost effective for the target market. Men, women, and
        especially children are becoming sick from dirty water consumption. Many people
        die because of the severity of their disease contracted by the contaminated water.</p>
